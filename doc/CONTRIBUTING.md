## Dependencies

* GNU make
* gcc or clang
* wayland
* wayland-protocols
* wlroots
* libinput
* yaml-cpp

Most will be available if you are running a wlroots based compositor like sway.

yaml-cpp will need to be installed via your distribution's package manager.

## Development

gcc is the default for packaging reasons, however clang is preferred.

Set CC and CXX when invoking make:

`make CC=clang CXX=clang++ ...`

[ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) using clang is configured via `.ccls`, for editors that support the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

### Compile

`make`

### Test

`make test`

[cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) is used for unit testing. Individual tests with `--wrap` definitions are defined in `tst/GNUmakefile`.

Please add tests when defining new functionality.

Individual tests may be run via test-name e.g.
`make test-cfg`

Valgrind test by appending `-vg` e.g.
`make test-vg`
`make test-cfg-vg`

### Lint

`make cppcheck`

Please resolve all issues before committing.

### Check Includes

[include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org/) is configured to run for `src` and `tst`.

`make iwyu`

Necessary changes will be indicated in the output with "should".

See all violations:

`make -k iwyu > /dev/null`

## Documentation

  * preview the man page via `man -l way-displays.1`
* commit both `way-displays.1.pandoc` and `way-displays.1`

## Style
